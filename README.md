=== Accordion Block ===



An Accordion block to show some magic.

== Description ==

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

Conflicts rage, peace seems to be astray.
Dark forces sow death, and evil holds sway.
But amidst the darkness, hope shines like a flame.
Brave heroes rise, united, they proclaim.

Stepping to the forefront, Jedi Knights appear,
With lightsabers ignited, dispelling fear.
Leading them all, a Master, wise and strong,
Yoda, the embodiment of right against wrong.

Amidst battles and shadows, we meet Skywalker,
Luke, Anakin's son, a destiny he does not bar.
From the dark side, he saves Princess Leia fair,
Together with their friends, they free the air.

The interstellar saga, it forever unfolds,
And we feel the Force with us, as our story holds.
Star Wars warms our hearts with its eternal flame,
Bringing light to a galaxy where darkness once came.

So may the Force be with us, in enlightenment's glow,
In this wide galaxy, let peace eternally grow.
And we shall always remember the heroes and their quest,
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
